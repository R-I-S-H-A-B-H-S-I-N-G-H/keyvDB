# KeyVDB

KeyVDB is a high-performance, in-memory key-value store designed to be a faster alternative to Redis while maintaining full compatibility with the Redis CLI. It aims to provide higher queries per second (QPS) and improved efficiency for demanding applications.

## Features
- **Redis-Compatible CLI**: Seamlessly interact with KeyVDB using the Redis command-line interface.
- **Blazing Fast Performance**: Optimized for higher throughput and lower latency than Redis.
- **In-Memory Storage**: Lightning-fast data access with efficient memory management.
- **Persistence Options**: Support for snapshotting and append-only file (AOF) persistence.
- **Pub/Sub Messaging**: Real-time event-driven architecture.
- **Geo Functionality**: Built-in geospatial commands for location-based operations.
- **Advanced Data Structures**: Strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, and streams.
- **Replication & Clustering**: Scale horizontally with master-replica replication and clustering support.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Go (latest version recommended)
- Redis CLI (optional, for compatibility testing)
